# Game Boi

Meet Game Boi!!

This is a super meat boy style game made for the GameBoy Jam 8. It's more a prototype than a full game through..

## How to play

Its an actual Gameboy rom, so requires an emulator to play; I recommend the BGB emulator found here.

## Controls

Jump is A. Left, right and up move you in those directions. When you die or at a splash screen press any button to restart.

## Bugs

Collision is a little wonky. If you find yourself stuck in a wall, jump and you should've fixed it.
